- What is DojiBar bot?

Dojibar is a Telegram bot that's sending you a message when your spot or future pending orders are executed, or when you place new orders, or when you cancel an order. It allows you to track your orders easily, keep an eye on your profit. Dojibar let's you reclaim your life as DojiBar will tell you as soon as your orders are executed: no need to stare at your screen!
It is connected to your Binance account through an API Key.

- Is DojiBar telegram bot secure?

Dojibar is designed to ensure your Binance API key is kept secret and we strive to protect your Binance account. In addition to that, DojiBar requires the most limited Binance API Key possible, a read-only one that can't make transactions or transfers, to limit the risks to the minimum, Zero. We also encourage you to limit this API key to a small set of IPs, which means even if a bad actor was to get a Binance API Key, he couldn't use it from a computer that is not one of Dojibar's own servers.

- What about my Privacy?

Dojibar is designed to keep the least amount of information required to perform its duty. It does remember your language, your first name for courtesy, your Binance API key, plus subscriptions and settings. Nothing more, because Dojibar needs nothing more. This way, Dojibar can't be the source of any data leak. Your Binance account data will not leak because of us!

- Why does DojiBar bot need my Binance key?

Dojibar contacts Binance with the API Key to receive notifications of order status changes. That's how it performs its job.

- Can DojiBar steal from me?

We strive to protect you and your Binance API Key so it doesn't happen. DojiBar will never require a priviledged key, but only a Read-only key which can't make transactions or transfer. If your Binance API key only allows reads, nobody can steal from you with this API Key.
